# This is me practicing react code here

# Use this code below to update my personal access token when it expired then i was able to push my code
git remote set-url origin https://<USERNAME>:<TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git

# Now just push your code like normal:

git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main  # or your branch


Done! âœ…
